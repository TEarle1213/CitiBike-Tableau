# CitiBike & Tableau

Exploration of 2 years of Citibike ride data from Jersey City. Data provided by Citibike (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) was cleaned and normalized in Pandas. Citibike separates data into monthly csvs. I used files from Jersey City in 2021 and 2022 to create dataframes for each year before exporting to new csvs. Methods used for this can be seen in included Jupyter Notebook. Afterwards, data was loaded into Tableau. There, I created a union of the two tables for exploration and analysis  before creating dashboards of visualizations.
