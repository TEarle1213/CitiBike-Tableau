# CitiBike & Tableau

Exploration of Citibike ride data across 4 summers (June through August). Data provided by Citibike (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) was cleaned and normalized in Pandas. Citibike separates data into monthly csvs. I used the June through August files for 2019-2022 and created dataframes for each summer by year before exporting to new csvs. Methods used for this can be seen in included Jupyter Notebook. Afterwards, data was loaded into Tableau. There, I created a union of the four tables and then filtered the data by usertype and ride length in order to target information about Tableau's membership behavior as well as to reduce the data to a size that Tableau Public could support. Tableau was utilized as an exploratory tool before creating dashboard of visualizations.
